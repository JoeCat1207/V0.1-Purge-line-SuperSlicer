# V0.1 Purge line SuperSlicer
 Purge line gcode macro for klipper on the voron v0.1 and start gcode for superslicer
Put the included Gcode Macro into your printer.cfg, there should be a PURGE LINE button that appears on your GUI after saving the edited config and restarting klipper. Now when you click it you extrude a purge line on the front of the buildplate. There should also be a command executed when pressing that button, specfically the "purge_line" command.

Now copy the included start gcodes into superslicer specifically into the "start gcode" part of Printer Settings and Custom Gcodes.

Save it as a new profile and your done! Happy Printing!
